  "body": "### Floyd Warshall Shortest Path\r\nThis project is a shortest path algorithm in c++ using Floyd Warshall algorithm. This program allows users to create nodes and add weights to the path between each of the nodes. After uses can input a start and end node will calculate the shortest path between these two nodes and output the path and the total weight.\r\n\r\n### Template Double Ended Queue\r\nThis project is a dynamic template double ended queue in c++. This means it allow users to create the double ended queue data structure of any data type (i.e. String, int, or any custom object type) as long as there is a to string function for that object. This double ended queue also grows dynamically with the number of items currently added to the queue. Its initial size is 8 but will increase or decrease depending on how many are added or removed.\r\n\r\n### OpenGL Points and Curves\r\nAn OpenGL c++ project that allows user to click to create new points on the screen. After ten points are added the program uses De Casteljau algorithm to calculate the De Casteljau smooth curve and draws them. This program uses a vector (not an array) to store the points thus not limiting the number of points that can be created. These points are store a vertex and point structs to more easily manipulate.\r\n\r\n### VR Da Vinci's Workshop Simulation\r\nIn this VR game created in unity with C# and java script the user can visit a simulation of Leonardo Da Vinci's Workshop and see the amazing machines Da Vinci created come to life. There are two different types of interaction, first an AR like experience where the user can see two inventions come to life and move on its own and the second where the user can operate Da Vinci's invention.\r\n",
